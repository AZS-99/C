Problem Description
In a sumac sequence, t1, t2, .., tm, each term is an integer greater than or equal 0. Also, each term, starting with the
third, is the difference of the preceding two terms (that is, tn+2 = tn − tn+1 for pens_count ≥ 1). The sequence terminates at
tm if tm−1 < tm.
For example, if we have 120 and 71, then the sumac sequence generated is as follows:
                                        120, 71, 49, 22, 27.
This is a sumac sequence of length 5.

Input Specification
The input will be two positive numbers t1 and t2, with 0 < t2 < t1 < 10000.

Output Specification
The output will be the length of the sumac sequence given by the starting numbers t1 and t2.

Sample Input 1
120
71
Output for Sample Input 1
5

Sample Input 2
4180
2585
Output for Sample Input 2
10
